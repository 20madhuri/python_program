1.python is open source software language(software downloaded in free version so python belongs)
2.python is interpreter language
2.1 python is called interpreter language because it doesnt compile.
2.2 doesnt compile means it doesnt create pre memory.
2.3 doesnt create pre memory means memory will be created on run time.
2.4 creating memory under run time is called as dynamic memory allocation.
2.5 anything that is dynamically alloted is what we call it as scripting language.
2.6 scripting language can also be interpreter language.


3.memory management in python is carried out by python virtual memory.
3.1 python virtual memory is called as PRIVATE HEAP.

4.python is called as unstructured programming language.
4.1 unstructured programming language means writing the codes without any template to be followed.

5.python is automated garbage collection.
5.1 automated garbage collection means variable that is not in use will be removed from the memory.(removal of unwanted)

6.python is case sensitive.

7.python is indent sprecific.

8.python is sequential program execution'
8.1 means it will read character by character or line by line
8.2 this line by line execution is happening because of the concept of GIL.
8.3 GIL MEANS global interpreter lock.
8.4 means when one line gets executed next line will be locked.
8.5 because of this mechanism python will be slower compared to other language.
